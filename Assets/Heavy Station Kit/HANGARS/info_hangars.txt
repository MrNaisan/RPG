HEAVY STATION KIT

--------------------
H A N G A R S   2.50
--------------------

MODELING
A new look for many objects. Flat surfaces were modified with less tris. Round ones like the railings received more. New objects were added to expand your opportunities for creative development.

MAPPING
To reduce drawcalls, most models were packaged into themes. Each theme uses a single material. Some UVs have a bit of free space, which has been reserved for future updates (thus adding new objects will not require additional materials).

TEXTURING
All the materials now have Metallic, Height and Occlusion maps, in addition to Albedo, Normal, and if it fits, Emission.

SCRIPTING
Earlier scripts have been corrected and expanded upon, and for widening the possibilities of the kit, new scripts have been created.

Includes Hangars v1.20, PLUS:
- New Materials
- New Prefabs
- Added Outside Theme
- Added Gateway Script
- Added Animated Textures

H A N G A R S   1.10
--------------------

- Fixed compability issue with Sci-Fi Heavy Station Kit base.
Previously, because of conflicted identical names of Meshes from different packages, these .fbx where overriding each other. Now names of such .fbx are modified so overriding no longer exists. Naming of corresponding Prefabs is not changed.
- Dot FPC was modified to be exact copy of Dot FPC from in Heavy Station kit base.
- Scripts that are necessary for compability were added.
- No overriding happens at combining two Kits, so Console log is clean.
- Info file was added to the package with Name and version of package as well as links to Forum, Web-site and e-mail.
